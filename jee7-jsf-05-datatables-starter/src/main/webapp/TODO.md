- Create a page named `people.xhtml` based on the template
- Create a data table that shows the people from the database
  - Add a Bootstrap style to the table
      - Hint: use `styleClass="table table-striped"`
- Add a "Remove" button in the last column of the table
  - Use this button to delete a person from the database
      - Hint: style with `styleClass="btn btn-xs btn-danger"`
      - Hint: add a `<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>` before the button text
  - What do you do when there are no more people in the database?
