- Create a `MethodTimerInterceptor` with the following properties:
  - It should record the time in nanoseconds using `System.nanoTime()`
  - It should log the execution time required for each service method in milliseconds to the console
  - It is applied on all your services
  - It is activated through an annotation called `@ActivateTimer`
